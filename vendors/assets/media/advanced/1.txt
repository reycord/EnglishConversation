We've known for half a century that Bob Dylan was a great writer.

He can sling words together and make them explode in your mind.

Try Subterranean Homesick Blues which has that great line, “You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

And it's not like Dylan hasn't gotten prizes before.

He's got an Oscar for Things Have Changed. 

He's got a Pulitzer Prize for Lifetime Achievement.

He's got the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

He's got a Medal of Honor from President Obama.

He's not a new discovery for the Nobel Prize to catch up with. 

The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2016 is awarded to Bob Dylan. 

He drew very clearly on surrealist poets like Rimbaud and Baudelaire.

He's got a lot of mentions of Shakespeare and the Bible in his songs. 

He also went to a body of literature that highbrow literature wasn't touching: songwriters that carried our collective memory.

Bob Dylan brought together two radically different traditions.

One is surrealism – our modern experience of images just rushing at us from every direction.

And the other was the way folk music tells stories. 

I think about a song like Cold Irons Bound.

It goes from this folk image to something that's really personal and really desolate.

Dylan can do a lot of things really well.

In a song like Tangled Up in Blue, he tells a long elaborate story that comes at you, just in a rush of images and a rush of incidents. 

A lot of his innovations got absorbed.

People write these wild, free associative lyrics now that they didn't write before Dylan.

People draw on high culture and low culture and outsider culture and insider culture in all these ways that Dylan was doing 50 years ago. 

He finally got the prize because, simply as a wordsmith and beyond the music, he's rearranged the way we all think
