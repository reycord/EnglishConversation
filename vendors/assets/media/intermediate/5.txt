<h1>Transcript: If I Could Fly</h1><p>I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I could fly like a bird.</p><p>Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.</p><p>You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.</p><p>You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.</p><p>You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.</p><p>If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my back yard and travel through town.</p><p>I would look down on the houses and factories.</p><p>When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.</p><p>I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.</p><p>I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.</p><p>I would dip and dive as I flew.</p><p>I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.</p><p>Have you ever flown?</p> <p>I know that you can not fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.</p><p>When you are in an airplane, you pass through clouds.</p><p>It is exciting to take an airplane ride.</p><p>I love taking airplane flights.</p><p>I like to look down at the Earth.</p><p>When you are up that high, everything below you looks tiny.</p><p>That is the closest I will get to flying like a bird.</p><p>But I can still use my imagination and spread my wings and soar high above the world just like a bird.</p>
