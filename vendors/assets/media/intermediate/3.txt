David: Oh my, you need to get help right away!
Jason: I know can you call an ambulance for me?
David: I don’t know the telephone number, but I will call the police.
Jason: Thanks, I don’t know what I would do without your help.
David: No problem.
Jason: Thanks again sir, you are a life saver!
David: While we wait for the police, what happened to cause this?
