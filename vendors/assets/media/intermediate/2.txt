Mike: (On the phone calling his friend, BJ)
	Hi BJ! Are you home?
	You sound sleepy.
BJ: Hey Mike!
	Yes, I am home and I am sleepy.
	You know why?
	It is already three in the morning, you know.
Mike: Hahahaha! That made me laugh in days!
	I’m sorry, dude.
	I can't sleep and you know why?
BJ: That’s ok, I understand.
	Why don’t you come by tomorrow for dinner and let’s talk about it?
Mike: Thanks, my friend.
	See you later tonight.
BJ: (Mike arriving at BJ’s place while outside grilling steaks for dinner)
	Hey Mike!
	Have a seat.
	Any particular beer for tonight?
Mike: I’ll have Corona if you got it.
	BJ, man, you really got to help me with my ex girlfriend, Shiela.
BJ: I’d like to help you but, what really happened?
	My wife and I were really surprised when we heard she left you and went straight to San Francisco.
Mike: Well, as a couple, we have small arguments.
	But I think what made her really mad was about financial problems.
BJ: Be more specific.
	Does she owe people money?
Mike: She owes money through her three credit cards.
	She keeps on buying stuff, but does not know how to pay.
BJ: If it’s her money then what do you care?
Mike: I told her she should start being responsible and start saving up as well for our wedding.
BJ: What did she say?
Mike: She told me it’s my responsibility to pay for everything.
	I immediately said that it is not only mine but the two of us since we are both working for years now.
BJ: So, she broke up with you just like that?
Mike: Not really. I think she has someone else.
BJ: What made you say that?
Mike: I read her texts and saw plenty of saved messages saying how the person cares for her.
BJ: My friend, that is really awful.
	I could not imagine how Sheila could do that.
	If I were you, I would not chase her for she had betrayed you for another man.
	But if you really love her and learn how to forgive, then, it is up to you.
