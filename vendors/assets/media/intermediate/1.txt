Mike: Hey Jason, can you come here for a minute?
	I need to talk to you about something.
Jason: Sure Mike, what would you like to talk about?
Mike: Well, last week I was in an accident at home.
	I just want to talk to you about it so that it doesn’t happen to you.
Jason: Ok, so what happened?
Mike: Well, I was trying to unclog the garbage disposal and I forgot to turn off the power.
Jason: You did what!
	How could you forget to turn off the switch?
Mike: Well, I did turn off the switch, but I forgot to turn off the breaker sending power to the switch.
	The next thing I know the dang cat jumped on the counter and turned on the garbage disposal.
Jason: Oh dear lord!
Mike: Yeah I know, but I was lucky, I only cut the tip of one of my fingers.
	But that is not the real point.
Jason: Ok so what is the real point then?
Mike: The real point is that even if you turn off a switch the power can be turned back on,
	so if you’re going to repair something electrical, always turn the power off at the breaker.
Jason: Ok, I will always remember that.
	Hey Mike, thanks for the tip on avoiding accidents.
Mike: No problem Jason, I just don’t want the same thing to happen to you.
